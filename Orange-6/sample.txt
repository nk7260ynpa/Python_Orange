(CNN)Could this be a very early campaign stunt?

Hip hop superstar Kanye West, who famously declared his intention to run for President in 2020, told a shocked audience in California that he didn't cast a vote in the presidential election earlier this month, but if he did, he "would have voted for Trump."
After the slightly-too-late endorsement for Donald Trump, the shock winner and now-President-elect, given between songs during the show at the SAP Center in San Jose on Thursday night, a large section of the audience booed the singer.
Trump's election has led to protests across the country, as well as a spike in hate crime.
